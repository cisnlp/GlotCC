**GlotCC is a multilingual corpus built by the GlotLID language identification and Ungoliant pipeline from CommonCrawl.** 

Current version ([V1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cis-lmu/GlotCC-V1)) supports more than **1000 languages** and is filtered based on adopted filters from C4, CCNet, MADLAD-400, RedPajama-Data-v2, OSCAR, Gopher, RefinedWeb, FineWeb, Datatrove, Dolma, Pile-CC, Pretrainer's Guide, and GlotScript.
