**GlotCC is a multilingual corpus built by the GlotLID language identification and cisnlp/Ungoliant pipeline from CommonCrawl.** 

Lastest version supports more than **1000 languages** and is filtered based on adopted filters from C4, CCNet, MADLAD-400, RedPajama-Data-v2, OSCAR, Gopher, RefinedWeb, FineWeb, Datatrove, Dolma, Pile-CC, Pretrainer's Guide, and GlotScript. â„¢ The logo features a llama with the style of C.C. from the Code Geass anime reading a book.

## Dataset 

GlotCC Dataset, Version 1: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/cis-lmu/GlotCC-V1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cis-lmu/GlotCC-V1)


## Running the pipeline

We forked oscar-project/ungoliant to cisnlp/ungoliant and made the necessary changes to integrate it with the [GlotLID](https://github.com/cisnlp/glotlid) language identification model.

For detailed instructions on running the pipeline, refer to the [cisnlp/ungoliant repository](https://github.com/cisnlp/ungoliant). The README is up-to-date.
