**GlotCC is a multilingual corpus built by the GlotLID language identification and Ungoliant pipeline from CommonCrawl.** 

Current version supports **1000 languages** and is filtered based on adopted filters from C4, CCNet, MADLAD-400, RedPajama-Data-v2, OSCAR, Gopher, RefinedWeb, FineWeb, Datatrove, Dolma, Pile-CC, Pretrainer's Guide, and GlotScript.
